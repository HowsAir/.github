# Let's know what we breathe with HowsAir
Welcome to HowsAir GitHub organization! We're glad you're here. Below is an outline of our ongoing projects and repositories:

## Description

HowsAir is an organization committed to informing users about the true quality of the air they breathe with the help of people like you, a CloudSensing community that finally are aware of what are they breathing.

### Problem Solved

Many people are unaware of the actual air quality in their immediate environment. Traditional air quality monitoring stations are often far apart and don't provide localized data. This project allows for real-time, hyperlocal air quality monitoring, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their outdoor activities and health.

### [Backend Services](https://github.com/HowsAir/server)
